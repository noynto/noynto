# You digged deep to found my profile... No, I'm kidding, kindly welcome

Well, my name is [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)), you probably expect that I'm a developer because of my [github profile](https://github.com/noynto) and yes that is TRUE. 

Humm, alright three things about me,

- **Learning**, like you and I do it every time in our lives, but I really enjoy learning new things mostly in the [IT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) area.
- **Testing and trying**, those are related to the previous point about [IT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) because how to be better at what you learn, except by doing it yourself.
- **Sharing**, maybe the end of those points because I know something and I just want to share to help others and also get credibility for what I know and what I can do.

Before I can continue, you should know that I'm a **freelancer** and you can contact me anytime.
