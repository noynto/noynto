# You digged deep to found my profile... No, I'm kidding, kindly welcome

Well, my name is [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)), you probably expect that I'm a developer because of my [github profile](https://github.com/noynto) and yes that is TRUE.

Humm, alright three things about me,

- **Learning**, like you and I do it every time in our lives, but I really enjoy learning new things mostly in the [IT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) area.
- **Testing and trying**, those are related to the previous point about [IT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) because how to be better at what you learn, except by doing it yourself.
- **Sharing**, maybe the end of those points because I know something and I just want to share to help others and also get credibility for what I know and what I can do.

Before I can continue, you should know that I'm a **freelancer** and you can [contact me](#how-to-contact-me) anytime.

## What am I able to do

I've started my journey as a backend developer with [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) as a partner. So, the Java language will be the basis of every [backend project](docs/server.md).

Also, as a backend developer, the [ops](docs/operator.md) zone is quite close, and I faced that *wall*. So, classical system operations, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) are enjoyable tools that I love to use and play with.

Nevertheless, a full *web* project cannot be fulfilled without an [interface](docs/interface.md)?! Thus, [Angular](https://angular.dev/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) are nasty choices that I've made the use of on most interfaces that I've done.
